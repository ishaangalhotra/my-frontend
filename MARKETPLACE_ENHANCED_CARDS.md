        const cardsHtml = enhancedProducts.map(product => 
            productCardUtils.generateProductCard(product)
        ).join('');
        container.innerHTML = `<div class="products-grid">${cardsHtml}</div>`;
    } else {
        // Fallback to original cards
        container.innerHTML = generateOriginalCards(appState.filteredProducts);
    }
